# JSON-Compiler-Python

This UCL coursework involved writing a lexer and parser using PLY.

PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) is a tool for generating lexers and parsers by specifying regular expressions and grammars.
The language I had to lex and parse for this coursework was JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
